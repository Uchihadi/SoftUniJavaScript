// Stack : Functions execute after functions until stack finished
// Function is placed in event queue until the prev function settled

// Heap is the place where objects are stored when we define variables.

// call stack is a mechanism JavaScript uses to keep track of functions.
// When we call a function, JavaScript will add that function to the call stack.

// JS = Single thread language (one call stack and heap at same time)
// Handles multiple ops on one thread
// the event creates a new function that is a callback function.
