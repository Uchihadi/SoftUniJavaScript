// DOM elements can be modified through their properties.
// Suppose there is the following HTML:

// InnerHTML returns and writes HTML of a given element
// value - gets and sets the value
// HTML Attributes & Methods
// getAttribute()

//Both NodeList and HTMLCollection are indexed collection of DOM nodes.
// However, HTMLCollection is limited only to Element nodes, while NodeList could hold nodes
// of any type.
// The two collections have the same methods, with the exception of NodeList's namedItem method.
